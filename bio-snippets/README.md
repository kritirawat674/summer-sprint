# 🧬 Bioinformatics Python Snippets

A collection of short Python scripts for practicing basic bioinformatics logic and data handling. These scripts were created during a summer self-study sprint to transition from wet-lab to dry-lab work in molecular genetics, with a focus on data-driven R&D.

## 🧪 Categories

### 🔹 1. DNA Tools
- Validate sequences using regex
- Clean messy sequence strings
- Analyze GC content and RNA transcripts

### 🔹 2. JSON Processing
- Parse gene expression from flat and nested JSON
- Filter genes with mutation data

### 🔹 3. XML Analysis
- Extract gene/sequence data from structured XML
- Identify high-expression genes in mock XML experiments

### 🔹 4. Web API Access
- Fetch gene metadata from NCBI using Python + `urllib`
